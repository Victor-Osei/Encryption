# Encryption
The programme uses a ceasar or shift cipher, a type of substitution cipher, to encrypt and decrypt messages. It prompts the user to choose between encryption and decryption modes, and then prompts the user to enter a key and the text to be encrypted or decrypted. Finally, it prints the result.
